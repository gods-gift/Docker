# Complete this script to deploy external-service and counter-service in two separate containers
# You will be using the conductor tool that you completed in task 3.

# Creating link to the tool within this directory
ln -s ../task3/conductor.sh conductor.sh
ln -s ../task3/setup.sh setup.sh

# use the above scripts to accomplish the following actions -

# Logical actions to do:
# 1. Build images for the containers
./conductor.sh build cs-image csfile
./conductor.sh build es-image esfile


# 2. Run two containers say es-cont and cs-cont which should run in background. Tip: to keep the container running
#    in background you should use a init program that will not interact with the terminal and will not
#    exit. e.g. sleep infinity, tail -f /dev/null
./conductor.sh run cs-image --detach cscont sleep infinity 
./conductor.sh run es-image --detach escont sleep infinity 

# 3. Configure network such that:
#    3.a: es-cont is connected to the internet and es-cont has its port 8080 forwarded to port 3000 of the host
#    3.b: cs-cont is connected to the internet and does not have any port exposed

./conductor.sh addnetwork -i cscont
./conductor.sh addnetwork -i -e 8080-3000 escont

#    3.c: peer network is setup between es-cont and cs-cont
./conductor.sh peer cscont escont

# 6. Within cs-cont launch the counter service using exec [path to counter-service directory within cs-cont]/run.sh
./conductor.sh exec cscont --detach /counter-service/counter-service 8080 1 

# 5. Get ip address of cs-cont. You should use script to get the ip address. 
#    You can use ip interface configuration within the host to get ip address of cs-cont or you can 
#    exec any command within cs-cont to get it's ip address
cscontIP=$(ip -4 addr show cscont-outside | awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
cscontIP=$(echo "$cscontIP" | sed 's/\.[0-9]*$/.2/')

# echo "cscontIP: $cscontIP"
sleep 5

# 7. Within es-cont launch the external service using exec [path to external-service directory within es-cont]/run.sh
./conductor.sh exec escont --detach python3 external-service/app.py "http://$cscontIP:8080/"
sleep 5
hostIP=$(ip -4 addr show enp0s3 | awk '/inet / {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
# echo "hostIP: $hostIP"


# 8. Within your host system open/curl the url: http://localhost:3000 to verify output of the service
curl http://$hostIP:3000/



# 9. On any system which can ping the host system open/curl the url: `http://<host-ip>:3000` to verify
#    output of the service
##(this works well , after forwarding port 3000 in network settings of VM)
